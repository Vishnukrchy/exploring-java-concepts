ðŸ”¥ STEP 1: Define a Simple Enum Day
âœ… Concept:
Java enum is basically a fixed set of constants. But unlike constants in C, Java enums can have methods, fields, constructors, and even abstract methods.
enum Day {
    MONDAY,
    TUESDAY,
    WEDNESDAY,
    THURSDAY,
    FRIDAY,
    SATURDAY,
    SUNDAY
}
ðŸ§  STEP 2: Add an Abstract Method
âœ… Concept:
Enums can define abstract methods that must be implemented by each constant individually.
enum Day {
    MONDAY {
        @Override
        public String getNumberOfDay() {
            return "1st day of the week";
        }
    },
    TUESDAY {
        @Override
        public String getNumberOfDay() {
            return "2nd day of the week";
        }
    },
    // ... same for other days ...

    SUNDAY {
        @Override
        public String getNumberOfDay() {
            return "7th day of the week";
        }
    };

    // Abstract method â€” must be implemented by all constants
    public abstract String getNumberOfDay();
}
ðŸ§ª STEP 3: Create a Class to Use the Enum
public class EnumTest {
    Day day;

    public EnumTest(Day day) {
        this.day = day;
    }
}
ðŸ§¨ STEP 4: Use the Enum and Call the Abstract Method
public class EnumTest {
    Day day;

    public EnumTest(Day day) {
        this.day = day;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        EnumTest test1 = new EnumTest(Day.MONDAY);
        System.out.println("The " + test1.day.name() + " is " + test1.day.getNumberOfDay());

        EnumTest test2 = new EnumTest(Day.SATURDAY);
        System.out.println("The " + test2.day.name() + " is " + test2.day.getNumberOfDay());
    }
}
The MONDAY is 1st day of the week
The SATURDAY is 6th day of the week

ðŸ’¥ STEP 5: Iterate Over Specific Enum Range Using EnumSet
âœ… Concept:
EnumSet.range(start, end) gives you a subset of the enum constants.

```java
EnumSet<Day> workDays = EnumSet.range(Day.TUESDAY, Day.FRIDAY);
for (Day d : workDays) {
    System.out.println(d.name() + ": " + d.getNumberOfDay());
}
```
TUESDAY: 2nd day of the week
WEDNESDAY: 3rd day of the week
THURSDAY: 4th day of the week
FRIDAY: 5th day of the week
