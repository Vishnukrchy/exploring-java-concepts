ðŸ’¡ Concept:
Enum constants call constructors internally once â€” when the enum is loaded.
You canâ€™t call enum constructor manually.

```java
public enum Role {
    ADMIN("Admin has full power"),
    USER("User has limited power");

    private final String description;

    // Constructor
    Role(String desc) {
        this.description = desc;
        System.out.println("Constructor called for: " + this.name());
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return description;
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(Role.ADMIN.getDescription());
    }
}
```
Output:
Constructor called for: ADMIN
Constructor called for: USER
Admin has full power
