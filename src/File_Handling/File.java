File Handling in Java
Java provides a rich set of APIs for file handling, allowing developers to read from and write to files, manage directories, and perform various file operations. The java.io package is primarily used for file handling in Java.
It includes classes for reading and writing files, such as FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, and more. Additionally, the java.nio package provides more advanced file handling capabilities with classes like Path, Files, and FileSystem.
This package provides classes and interfaces for file handling, including reading and writing files, managing directories, and performing various file operations.

File handling is a crucial aspect of Java programming, enabling developers to work with files and directories efficiently. It allows for reading and writing data to files, managing file metadata, and performing various file operations such as copying, moving, and deleting files.
Operations such as reading from a file, writing to a file, and checking if a file exists are common tasks in many applications. Java's file handling capabilities make it easy to perform these operations in a platform-independent manner.

public class File {
    // This class can be used to implement file handling operations in Java.
    // It can include methods for reading from and writing to files, managing directories, and performing various file operations.
    // For example, you can create methods to read a file line by line, write data to a file, check if a file exists, and so on.

            try {
                java.io.FileReader fileReader = new java.io.FileReader(filePath);
